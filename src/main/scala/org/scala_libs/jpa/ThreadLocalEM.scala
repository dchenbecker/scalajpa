 * This trait can be mixed in so that an object may provide
 * access to EntityManager instances on a thread-local basis.
 * An example would be:
 *
 * <pre>
 * object MyEM extends LocalEMF("test") with ThreadLocalEM
 *
 * ...
 * MyEM.createNamedQuery(...)
 *
 * MyEM.cleanup()
 * ...
 * 
 * </pre>
 *
 * Best practice for this code is to ensure that when the
 * thread exits it calls the cleanup method so that the EM is properly closed.
